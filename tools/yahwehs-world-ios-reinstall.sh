# Scheduled Yahweh's World reinstall — iPhone + iPad + this Mac.
#
# Exists for the same reason its sibling does: the free Apple ID
# signing certificate expires every 7 days, so a native install
# silently stops launching unless something re-signs it. Each fire:
#
#   1. git pull origin main          — pick up the latest committed code
#   2. flutter build ios --release   — signed via the Xcode account
#   3. xcrun devicectl install       — iPhone, then iPad
#   4. flutter build macos --release — replaces /Applications copy
#
# Deliberately a SEPARATE script from yswords-ios-reinstall.sh rather
# than another roster entry in it: that script carries flavor builds,
# alt-icon injection, and an Android leg this app has no use for, and
# it is the main app's working schedule — a shared edit risks both.
#
# Per-device failures are isolated: one device asleep must not stop
# the others. Exit 0 iff at least one target got the build.
#
# Triggered by: ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.yahwehsworld.ios-reinstall.plist
# Log:          /tmp/yahwehs-world-ios-reinstall.log (rotates each run)
#
# Prerequisites (same as the sibling script):
#   1. Mac awake at the fire time.
#   2. iPhone + iPad on the same WiFi, paired via "Connect via network"
#      in Xcode → Devices and Simulators. Locked is fine; deep sleep or
#      airplane mode is not.
#   3. A signed-in Apple Account in Xcode → Settings → Accounts. When
#      that session expires the build fails with "No Accounts" and the
#      only fix is signing in again by hand.
#
# Manual run:
#   ~/Documents/CodingProject/yahwehs_world/tools/yahwehs-world-ios-reinstall.sh

# No `set -e` — a failure on one device must not abort the rest.
