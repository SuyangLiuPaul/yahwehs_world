## What it is

Every story in the feed — across the World, China, Hong Kong, Australia, Science & Nature, Tech, Creation, and Documentary desks — is automatically matched by AI to a Bible verse and a short reflection connecting the two. Tap a headline and you get the original article summary side-by-side with the verse, its reference (localized to 马太福音-style Chinese book names, not just "Matthew"), and why it applies.

It's a dedicated reader, not a scraper: all content is pulled from **[yswords-data](https://yswords-data.netlify.app/data/daily_news.json)**, a shared, CORS-enabled data pipeline that already runs hourly for a sister Bible-reading app. This project is the read-only client for that feed.

## Features

- **Bilingual throughout** — every headline, summary, article body, verse, and reflection ships with both an English and a 简体中文 version; toggle instantly with the EN/中文 button, no reload.
- **Eight desks — World / China / Hong Kong / Australia / Science & Nature / Tech / Creation / Documentary** — from trusted outlets (BBC, The Guardian, SBS, DW, SCMP, HKFP, RTHK, Nature, ScienceDaily, Phys.org, Ars Technica, Mongabay, Yale Environment 360, IndieWire), filterable with a single tap. Creation covers nature, wildlife, and the state of the earth; Documentary surfaces new film/TV documentary coverage. The filter chips are driven by the feed itself, so new desks appear without an app update.
- **Responsive master-detail layout** — single column on phone-width screens, a list-plus-reading-pane layout on anything ≥880px wide.
- **Infinite scroll into history** — once you reach the bottom of today's edition, the feed keeps paging in previous days from a rolling 90-day archive.
- **Verse Lens card** — the app's actual differentiator: the AI-picked verse, its text in the reader's language, a one-line theme tag, and a reflection paragraph connecting the story to Scripture.
- **Offline-first loading** — a three-tier fallback (last successful fetch → bundled snapshot → live network) means the feed renders instantly even on a slow connection, then quietly upgrades itself in the background.
- **Dark mode**, system-driven by default.

## Tech stack

- **Flutter** (web + Android + iOS + macOS from one codebase), Dart ^3.12
- **provider** for the small amount of app-wide state (locale, theme)
- **http** + **shared_preferences** for the data layer — no backend of its own
- Deployed to **Netlify** (web) via the Netlify CLI; native builds distributed as [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/SuyangLiuPaul/yahwehs_world/releases)

## Getting started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SuyangLiuPaul/yahwehs_world.git
cd yahwehs_world
flutter pub get
flutter run -d chrome   # or -d macos / an attached iOS or Android device
```

Run the test suite:

```bash
flutter test
```

The app talks to the public `yswords-data` feed by default — no API key or backend setup required. To point it at a different feed during development:

```bash
flutter run -d chrome --dart-define=DAILY_NEWS_URL=https://example.com/daily_news.json
```

## Documentation

The README covers the essentials; the full write-up — architecture, the `yswords-data` schema this app consumes, and the engineering notes behind some non-obvious fixes (a CJK font race on cold load, a CORS quirk that silently broke a third of all images, why the cache layer needed a rethink) — lives on the project's GitHub Pages site:

## Data & attribution

Headlines, summaries, and images originate from their original publishers (The Guardian, BBC News, DW, SBS News) via their public RSS feeds; this app always links back to the original article ("Read original") rather than reproducing it in full. The Bible verse pairing, translation, and reflection are AI-generated by the upstream `yswords-data` pipeline.

- **[yswords-data](https://yswords-data.netlify.app)** — the shared data pipeline this app reads from (RSS ingestion, AI verse-matching, translation, image hosting).
- **[YsWords](https://yswords.netlify.app)** — the sister Bible-reading app this news feed was originally built for, before being split out into its own dedicated reader.
